## Overview
This project focuses on using machine learning to enhance communication security by accurately classifying SMS messages as either legitimate ("ham") or unwanted ("spam"). Using the SMS Spam Collection dataset and advanced neural networks, I developed a robust solution achieving a high accuracy of 98.78% in identifying spam messages. Through meticulous data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training, the system effectively handles varying message lengths and vocabulary complexities.

## Key Features
- Implemented a deep neural network model for SMS spam classification.
- Achieved a validation accuracy of 98.78% in distinguishing between ham and spam messages.
- Demonstrated proficiency in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation techniques.

## Project Details
