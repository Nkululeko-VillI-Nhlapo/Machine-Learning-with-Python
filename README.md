# Machine Learning Projects
<hr>

This repository contains several machine learning projects:


1. **Book Recommendation System using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Utilizes the Book-Crossings dataset to recommend books based on user ratings.
   
2. **Cat and Dog Image Classifier**: Employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs with high accuracy.
   
3. **Linear Regression Health Costs Calculator**: Predicts medical expenses using a neural network based on demographic and lifestyle factors.
   
4. **Neural Network SMS Text Classifier**: Achieves a high accuracy of 98.78% in classifying SMS messages as spam or ham.
   
5. **Rock-Paper-Scissors Strategy Game**: Uses reinforcement learning to predict and counter opponent moves, achieving high win rates against predefined strategies.
