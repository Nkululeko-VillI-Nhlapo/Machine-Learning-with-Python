- This project is part of my journey towards the freeCodeCamp Machine Learning certification, ** focusing on reinforcement learning ** applied to the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. 
- Implemented in Python, the strategy adapts dynamically based on the opponent's previous moves to predict and counter effectively. 
- Throughout the project, I've tracked scores and win rates against predefined opponent strategies such as Quincy, Abbey, Kris, and Mrugesh. 
- The results show significant performance, with Player 1(ME) achieving a win rate of 99.80% against Quincy, 63.46% against Abbey, 61.09% against Kris, and 77.89% against Mrugesh over 1000 games each. By analyzing historical gameplay data, the project aims to optimize decision-making and enhance performance in strategic gaming scenarios. 
- This initiative not only explores foundational concepts in reinforcement learning but also provides hands-on experience in applying machine learning techniques to improve gameplay strategies.
